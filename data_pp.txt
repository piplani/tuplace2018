This is a regression problem , we are given a dataset having some known facial key-points and the system has to find other key-points. A model was built to solve the issue, name of which was 'Average Patch Model' . The idea is to extract a patch around every keypoint in each image, and average the result. This average_patch can then be used as a mask to search for the keypoint in test images.we do this for each of the keypoints such as  eyes(both individually), ears(same thing), nose etc. In total, we have 7049 rows, each one with 31 columns. The first 30 columns are keypoint locations which were correctly identified as numbers. The last one is a string representation of the image, identified as a string.

composed of primary and secondary windings and can be connected in either star or delta formations. Detection of faults in such
high power transformers is crucial and can help in reducing such faults up to a great extent. The ensemble model is used for the
detection of five faults in three phase transformer. Seven feature selection techniques and seven machine learning models have
been used, out of which five best possible combinations are selected for ensemble model. Five different operating conditions
are discussed namely normal condition, inrush, over excitation, internal fault and external fault. These faults are classified by 30
features i.e. 10 samples of three phase differential current have been used. 420 simulated samples have been generated using
sim power systems of MATLAB/SIMULINK under different conditions of Y-Y transformer. Cross Validation is done to show the
robustness and consistency of the best predictive models on which ensemble model is applied. The results show that on applying
ensemble techniques, the accuracy improves significantly to about 85.652% in fault prediction based on the dataset."	; Recommendation System ;	R | Python | Matlab ;	ML (Machine Learning) ;	PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) ;	Five ;	Name -Tejasvi Roop Singh.

~ 54 ;	Fruits (Apple) Grading System ;	Manual grading of apples is time consuming and error prone. Around 20 Lakh tones of Apple are produced in India every year. But due to the lack of post-harvest processing steps Indian fruits are not competitive in world market as it supposed to be. As an important step in fruit production and marketing, fruit grading can reduce production costs in different ways such as storage, packaging, shopping etc. So there is a need for grading of apples using multiple parameters. In this research, we designed and implemented a novel detection system based on embedded platform that covers full function of apple size, color, disease detection and weight measurement but with much lower cost. The experimental results shows the size, color and weight of the apple.	; Image Processing ;	Python | Matlab ;	Artificial Neural Network ;	NULL ;	Four ;	Ashutosh Sagar, 9781201910, 1997ashutosh@gmail.com ;	NULL ;	Device ;

This is a few-shot learning approach that delivers security-grade accuracy. A GUI has been made for capturing images and detecting faces using a MTCNN detector (Multi-Task Cascaded Neural Network).

Information Retrieval (MIR) has been an area of interest among
researchers. A music genre is characterized by various features related to
instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and form of members. To identify
the genre of a given audio file has been a big challenge for the MIR
community. This work describes a novel approach for classifying music
into different genres. The feature vector for various audio files is obtained
and various machine learning models are trained and their performance
matrix is computed accordingly. An ensemble model is proposed to
improve the performance of the usual classifiers which yields an average
accuracy of 85%. Further, K-Fold cross validation has been performed to
check the consistency of the proposed ensemble model. The superiority
of the proposed ensemble model is validated using topsis analysis and a
score of 0.97 is obtained."	; Audio Processing ;	R | Python ;	ML (Machine Learning) | Hybrid Method ;	GA (Genetic Algorithm) ;	Two ;	Parth Rohilla, 8527535298 ;	NULL ;	Algorithm ;
