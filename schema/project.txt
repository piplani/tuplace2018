composed of primary and secondary windings and can be connected in either star or delta formations. Detection of faults in such

detection of five faults in three phase transformer. Seven feature selection techniques and seven machine learning models have
been used, out of which five best possible combinations are selected for ensemble model. Five different operating conditions
are discussed namely normal condition, inrush, over excitation, internal fault and external fault. These faults are classified by 30
features i.e. 10 samples of three phase differential current have been used. 420 simulated samples have been generated using
sim power systems of MATLAB/SIMULINK under different conditions of Y-Y transformer. Cross Validation is done to show the
robustness and consistency of the best predictive models on which ensemble model is applied. The results show that on applying
ensemble techniques, the accuracy improves significantly to about 85.652% in fault prediction based on the dataset."	Five ;	Name -Tejasvi Roop Singh. Contact - 9855304741. Email ID tejasvichandi@gmail.com ;	NULL ;

~ 67 ;	Image Forgery Detection ;	The authenticity and reliability of digital images are increasingly important due to the ease in modifying such images. Thus, the capability to identify image manipulation is a current research focus, and a key domain in digital image authentication is Copy-move forgery detection (CMFD). We used deep learning (TensorFlow and TFLearn) to detect forgery in the digital images.	Three ;	Vivek Kapoor, 7696443988, vivekkapoor97@gmail.com ;	NULL ;

~ 72 ;	Automatic Classification of Audio Genres using Ensemble Methods ;	"Music Genre classification which comes under the area of Music
Information Retrieval (MIR) has been an area of interest among
researchers. A music genre is characterized by various features related to
instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and form of members. To identify
the genre of a given audio file has been a big challenge for the MIR
community. This work describes a novel approach for classifying music
into different genres. The feature vector for various audio files is obtained
and various machine learning models are trained and their performance
matrix is computed accordingly. An ensemble model is proposed to
improve the performance of the usual classifiers which yields an average
accuracy of 85%. Further, K-Fold cross validation has been performed to
check the consistency of the proposed ensemble model. The superiority
of the proposed ensemble model is validated using topsis analysis and a
score of 0.97 is obtained."	Two ;	Parth Rohilla, 8527535298 ;	NULL ;
~ 73 ;	Classification of Resting, Targeted and Non-Targeted states using Convolutional Neural Networks in fMRI images ;	"Deep learning approaches have been increasingly explored in the field of functional connectivity due to their ability to extract deep features and better classification. However, application of these techniques in classification of brain networks during different task engagement and Resting State Networks (RSN) is still remain largely unexplored.
Hence, in this work, a hybrid deep learning architecture consists of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE) and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) was employed for classification of brain networks estimated during visual target and non-target engagement and RSNs."

At first the system detects the gender of the person and ask for query . Then the query of the subject is recorded answer of which is searched in the predesigned database . If the system do not have pre saved answers for query then the system learns the and and store in the database and hence learns to answer the query .
The whole process uses Supervised learning method for the training and testing .
The domain of the project was restricted to institution ."	Four ;	Konark Nigam, 8195914675, nigamkonark51@gmail.com ;	NULL ;
